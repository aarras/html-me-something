                <h2>Building A Workshop</h2>
                <p>I didn't have much space in my first house, so I was excited to convert the garage of my next home into a workshop. Thankfully, there wasn't much to remove from the garage, but I had only one existing electrical outlet, so I needed to run outlets to all sides of the building. I added 2 sets of outlets to every wall and one overhead so I was never far from power. I also added some new lighting to brighten it up. After the electrical was done, I insulated the walls for working through the winter, and covered them with plywood to allow me to hang whatever I needed anywhere on the walls.</p>

                <h2>Some of my Projects</h2>
                <p>Unfortunately, I'm awful about remembering to take pictures while I work, but I have a few to share.</p>

                <h3>STL Skyline</h3>
                <p>The first one is an 8' long silhouette of the St. Louis skyline that I hand cut out of a piece of oak plywood. It now resides in the lounge of my previous employer's office.</p>

                <h3>Displays for an Artist</h3>
                <p>A local artist that was painting hearts for various hospitals needed to hang her work somehow so it could be easily displayed. I developed a design and stencil for her to be able to easily create displays in many different patterns without needing much skill in woodworking. I built the first two for her (below) and even modified the second one to meet code requirements by the hospital for weight limit and fire resistance.</p>

                <h3>Wedding Gift for a Co-Worker</h3>
                <p>Since I'm terrible at buying gifts, I decided to make one for my co-worker instead. I spent a couple weeks hand cutting, filing, and sanding the letters.</p>

                <p>This s'mores bar was requested for my little sister's wedding. It's pretty simple, but I have pictures of it in use that look good, so I thought I'd share.</p>

                <h3>Cutting Boards for Christmas</h3>
                <p>Again, terrible with buying gifts, so I made most of my family cutting boards for Christmas in 2019. They were all made with Maple, Walnut, and Cherry wood.</p>
